# Lyrify

Lyrify is a macOS application to load lyrics for the currently playing Spotify song.

The only reason that this is OS X specific is that it uses Applescript to grab the currently playing song title and artist. Whereas Windows can grab this information using window titles, OS X has no such ability.

This is built on Electron.
