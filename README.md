#Lyrify

!This project is still currently under development. Neither functionality nor polish is there at the moment. Do not expect anything to work.

Lyrify is an OS X (macOS?) application to load lyrics for the currently playing Spotify song.

With the sad departure of Musicxmatch from Spotify, there has been no introduction of a native lyrics viewer. Spotify has made claims that they are working on one currently but it has been 6 months of sadness.

The only reason that this is OS X specific is that it uses Applescript to grab the currently playing song title and artist. Whereas Windows can grab this information using window titles, OS X has no such ability.
This is built on Electron.
